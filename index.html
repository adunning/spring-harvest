<h1 id="note">Note</h1>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">The</span> poems of this book were written at very various times, one (“Wind over the Sea”) I believe even as early as 1910, but the order in which they are here given is not chronological beyond the fact that the third part contains only poems written after the outbreak of the war. Of these some were written in England (at Oxford in particular), some in Wales and very many during a year in France from November 1915 to December 1916, which was broken by one leave in the middle of May.</p>
<p>“The Burial of Sophocles,” which is here placed at the end, was begun before the war and continued at odd times and in various circumstances afterwards; the final version was sent me from the trenches.</p>
<p>Beyond these few facts no prelude and no <em>envoi</em> is needed other than those here printed as their author left them.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">If</span> there be one among the Muses nine<br />Loves not so much <em>Completion</em> as <em>the Will</em>,<br />And less the austere saint than the fond sinner:<br />Loves scanty ruins, garlanded with years,<br />Better than lofty palaces entire:<br />To her I dedicate this spoiléd sheaf<br />Of rime that scarcely came to harvesting.</p>
<p>There is a window here in Magdalen<br />Composite, methinks, of fragments that stark Mars<br />Has scattered. Even so my verses be<br />Composite of memories and half-uttered dreams<br />Welded together sans due ordinance,<br />Which might have been far other, but that Mars<br />Scattered and harried them with his ruthless flail.</p>

<h2 id="glastonbury">Glastonbury</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Thither</span> through moaning woods came Bedivere,<br />At gloomy breaking of a winter’s day,<br />Weary and travel-stained and sick at heart,<br />With a great wound gotten in that last fray<br />Ere he stood by, and watched the King depart<br />Down the long, silent reaches of the mere:<br />And all the earth was sad, and skies were drear,<br />And the wind cried, and chased the relict leaves<br />Like ships, that the storm-tossed ocean batters and heaves,<br />And they fly before the gale, and the mariners fear.</p>
<p>So he found at the last an hermitage<br />Hard by a little hill, and sheltering trees<br />That bent gaunt branches in the winter’s breeze;<br />And he drew rein, and leant, and struck the door:<br />Then presently came forth an hermit sage<br />And helped him to dismount with labour sore:<br />Straight went they in, but Bedivere being lame<br />Stumbled against the open door, and swooned,<br />And would have fallen, but the hermit caught<br />And laid him gently down; then hurrying brought<br />From a great chest a cordial, and came<br />That he might drink, and so beheld his wound.</p>
<p>Long time lay Bedivere betwixt life and death,<br />Like a torn traveller on a stormy height<br />’Twixt one wind and another: till his breath<br />Came easier, and he prospered. Then did sleep<br />Bathe him in soothing waters, soft and deep,<br />And left him whole, at breaking of the light,<br />So he beheld the old man, and desired<br />That he would tell of whom he was, and whence.</p>
<!-- 14 -->
<p>Whereat once more the ancient eyes were fired:<br />“I, I was Arthur’s bishop, at his court<br />And in his church I ministered, and thence<br />When at the last the whole was overthrown<br />With wrath and ill designings, straight I sought<br />A place where I might die, too feeble grown<br />To endure a new beginning to my years<br />When once the past was lost, and whelmed in tears.<br />Hither I came, where, in the dawns of time<br />Dim peoples, that the very stones forget,<br />Lived, loved, and fought, and wove the riddling rime<br />On a lake island mystically set.<br />They passed, and after ages manifold<br />Came wandering sainted Joseph (even he<br />That tended God’s frail body, and enrolled<br />In linen clothes of spiced fragrancy).<br />He brought the vessel, vanished now from earth<br />That wrought destruction to the Table Round,<br />Since many deemed themselves above their worth<br />And sought in vain, and perished ere they found.”</p>
<p>Then Bedivere: “Alas the King! I saw<br />The unstayed overwhelming tide of war:<br />And when the opposèd standards were unfurled<br />Of Arthur and of Mordred, his base son,<br />Ere yet the noise of battle was begun<br />I heard the heralds crying to the world:</p>
<p>“‘Ye that have sought out pallid harmonies<br />Where never wind blows, save the gentle south:<br />Ye that have trafficked on the sounding seas<br />And fear nor cheerless rains, nor scorching drouth:</p>
<p>“‘Ye that have piled the rich, full-ripened crops<br />Of word and measure, till the rime, grown proud,<br />Did straight contemn the leaping mountain tops<br />And lose itself in air, and riven cloud:</p>
<!-- 15 -->
<p>“‘Ye that have lived a dangerous life of war<br />Whose speech has been bold words and heady boasts<br />Gather, for strife and death unknown before,<br />Come gather all unto the fronting hosts.’</p>
<p>“I saw the last dim battle in the mist<br />There, where a dreary waste of barren sand<br />Doth mark the ultimate leagues of this fair land;<br />Scarce we beheld the foe we struck, or wist<br />Which party had advantage: like thin wraiths<br />Fit to throng Lethe banks the warriors<br />Struck and o’ercame, or fell, unseen, unwept;<br />And alien hopes, lives, peoples, alien faiths<br />Were all confounded on those desolate shores.<br />And ever the mist seethed, and the waves kept<br />A hollow chanting, as they mourned the end<br />Of all mankind, and of created time.<br />How many fell therein of foe or friend<br />I know not, save that when the darkness came<br />And the mist cleared, I found at last the King,<br />His armour and visage fouled with blood and slime,<br />And fading in his eyes the ancient flame.</p>
<p>“I saw him make on Mordred with his spear,<br />And crying ‘Tide me death, betide me life,<br />He shall not live, that wrought the accursed thing,’<br />Put a dread ending to the outworn strife.<br />I saw them fall together, and, drawn near.<br />Knew that the King was wounded unto death.</p>
<p>“Then as he drew with growing pain his breath<br />I looked, and saw a long, black barge that stole<br />Across the waters, like a wandering soul<br />Returnèd from the woeful realm, to view<br />The ancient haunts well-loved that once it knew.<br />And when it touched the shallows I did bear<br />The dying Arthur as he bade, and there<br /><!-- 16 -->I placed him ’mid dark forms: I could not tell<br />Whose they might be; and wept, and breathed farewell.”</p>
<p>Then spake the eremite: “Beyond yon door<br />There stands a chapel, ancient and weatherworn,<br />And there did worship in the days of yore<br />The sons of kings. The night ere you came hither<br />I was awakened by the sound of feet.<br />And I looked forth, and saw a body borne<br />By veilèd figures straight, as they knew whither,<br />In at the chapel gateway. I went down<br />And found that they had digged a grave, most meet<br />For one of saintly life, or king by birth:<br />They seemed some score, and by blown candles’ light<br />I saw that each with tears bedewed his gown<br />Ere sank the corse into the waiting earth,<br />Then prayed, and so went out into the night.”</p>
<p>Thereon the twain arose, and went straightway<br />Toward the old, dim chapel, and beheld<br />The stone beneath whose length the body lay:<br />Kneeling they closely scanned it all, and spelled<br />Graven in golden character, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">“Arcturus<br />Rex Quondamque Futurus.”</span></p>
<p>                                Quoth Bedivere:<br />“Thank God this voice remaineth unto us;<br />Now I do mind me of a prophecy<br />Spoken long since in some emblazoned year,<br />How Arthur should escape mortality<br />And lie beneath the hills, in cavern deep<br />Or on some shore, where faery seas do break:<br />Around him all his warriors shall sleep,<br />Who at a great bell’s sounding shall awake<br />What time th’ old enemy spreads death and harm<br />Thorough his ancient realm, and the last woes<br />Go over her; his own victorious arm<br />Shall rid the stricken land of hate and foes.”</p>
<!-- 17 -->
<p>So leave we them, each head inaureoled<br />With the awakening spring’s young sunlight-gold.</p>
<p>Then, on an evening, hurrying footsteps rung<br />Without the door, and straight ’twas open flung,<br />They saw who stood therein, and each one knew<br />The face unspared by years and strife and shame,<br />Pale as the moon is pale on winter nights,<br />With deep eyes dreaming like September haze,<br />Or lit with lust of battle, eyes that few<br />Had looked on and forgot; in such wise came<br />Lancelot, the hero of immortal fights,<br />Lancelot, the golden knight of golden days.</p>
<p>“Whence cam’st thou, Lancelot?” “Even from the<br />    Queen,<br />The Queen that was, whom now a convent’s shade<br />Imprisons, and a dark and tristful veil<br />Enwraps those brows, that in old days were seen<br />Most puissant proud of all that ever made<br />The traitor honest, and the valorous frail.</p>
<p>“Yet evermore about her form there clings<br />And evermore shall cling, the ancient grace,<br />Like evening sunlight lingering on the mere:<br />And till the end of all created things<br />There shall be some one found, shall strive to trace<br />The immortal loveliness of Guinevere.</p>
<p>“Shall I not mind me of old ecstasies<br />In Camelot, beneath the ancient walls,<br />In shady paths, and marble terraces<br />Rose-fragrant, where eternal sunlight falls.<br />But ah! the last long kiss is ta’en and given,<br />And the last look in those unfathomed eyes,<br />The passionate last embrace is coldly riven,<br />And all is grief, beneath the pitiless skies.</p>
<!-- 18 -->
<p>“Gods of the burnt-out hearth, the wandered wind,<br />Gods of pale dawns that vanished long ago,<br />Gods of the barren tree, the withered leaf.<br />The faded flower, and the ungarnered sheaf,<br />Gods half-forgot in the wild ages’ flow<br />Yours, yours am I, that all for nought have sinned.”</p>
<p>Spring, summer passed away, and autumn rain<br />Swelled the lean brooks, until the gelid year<br />Shot forth its icy hand, and grasped again.<br />Again the hanging clouds were struck and furled<br />By winds of winter, until skies were clear,<br />And there was frost o’ nights, and all the world<br />Lay glistening to the newly risen sun.</p>
<p>Till came that season, wherein solemn days<br />Do celebrate the reign on earth begun<br />Of the most blessèd Child, whenas all ways<br />Were bound, and all the fields were white with snow.<br />Then in the chapel at high noon they three<br />Offered their quiet orisons and so<br />Came forth and looked upon the purity,<br />And when he saw the fields all stainless-white<br />Lancelot groaned in spirit, and spake: “How sore<br />And no wise joyous to a sinner’s sight<br />Is this dear land, where the snow lies untrod.<br />Even so once before the eyes of God<br />My soul lay all unspotted; now no more.”</p>
<p>“Courage, my son, and patience,” quoth the sage;<br />No sin there is, that shall not lose its stain<br />Through the great love of God, and His dear Son.<!-- Source has a comma. (AD) --><br />Repent and be forgiven: know that none<br />Shall sue before His throne, and sue in vain,<br />Nor shall one name be blotted from the page<br />If he that bears it turn to prayer and tears.”</p>
<!-- 19 -->
<p>Then Lancelot: “Though through the tale of years<br />That still are left before the longed-for earth<br />Receive my body, I should strive amain<br />To slay myself, and gain regenerate birth,<br />Alas it were all profitless and vain.<br />Verily, when I came unto this place<br />I railed on God, that I had lost my soul<br />And nothing gained: until a heavenly grace<br />Enwrapped me, like some sick man made half whole,<br />And now my grief is only for old sin.<br />But ah, what boots it? Lo, this barren tree<br />(He touched a shrub that grew beside the door),<br />This tree, methinks, shall bud and blossom before<br />I pass the gates divine, and enter in<br />To the fair country I must never see.”</p>
<p>But even as he spoke, the hand of God<br />Worked on the sombre branches, and straightway<br />They were all green with sap, and bud, and leaf,<br />As at the very bidding of the spring,<br />Burst forth, and soon each tender branch was gay<br />With flowers that nodded in the winter’s breeze<br />(So blossomed in old time the prophet’s rod),<br />And Lancelot stood and saw the wondrous thing.</p>
<p>Then softly spake the hermit, “Now is grief<br />Reproved, and sorrow cast out with the lees;<br />For God beholds the living, not the dead;<br />And He that took the semblance of a child<br />Loves He but penance, and the drooping head,<br />Has He not sung for joy, has He not smiled?”</p>
<p>So they grew old together, and the years<br />Pressed no more to their lips the cup of tears<br />(They had drained all, maybe). And ever less<br />Seemed all things mortal, as in quietness<br />They pondered the eternal mysteries<br />(The noblest heritage of all men born),<br /><!-- 20 -->Such as are writ upon the face of dawn,<br />Or in the glamour of a moonlit night,<br />Or in the autumn swallow’s southern flight,<br />Or in the breaking of the restless seas:<br />Or dreamed rich, hallowed dreams of aureate days<br />While yet the King was young, and sunlight fell<br />On bower and roof of ancient Camelot:<br />Of triumph clarion, and thanksgiving bell,<br />When all was song, and laughter, and high praise,<br />Even when as yet the accursed thing was not.</p>
<p>Then would loom out from the chill mists of time<br />The faces and the forms remembered still,<br />The King and Guinevere, and Galahad,<br />That rode upon a peerless quest and dire,<br />Kay, swift and hasty as a flame of fire,<br />And gentle Percival, whom to give made glad;<br />Merlin, contriver of the riddling rime,<br />And Gawain, silent harbinger of ill.</p>
<p>So as the day draws ever toward the dark,<br />Ever toward peace the great wind’s sounding breath,<br />And ever toward the further shore the bark<br />They drew to the dark, silent realm of death.</p>
<p>Far, far away from their old palace-halls<br />Where once they lived a splendid life and vain,<br />That now are scattered stones and crumbled walls<br />In some soft vale, or by the echoing main,</p>
<p>Beneath the springing grass, and very deep<br />They three do lie, where never mornings rise<br />To ope the portals of their dazèd eyes,<br />Nor ever mortal footstep breaks their sleep,</p>
<p>And near beside lies Arthur, even he<br />That was King once, and yet again shall be.</p>
<!-- 21 -->
<h2 id="legend">Legend</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Grey,</span> ancient abbeys, you may see them yet,<br />In that high plain above the western sea:<br />A broken arch or two, a few worn stones<br />Piled one upon another, and for paving<br />Uneven fragments with tall grass between:<br />Grass that is always green, winter and summer,<br />The grass that grows on long-forgotten graves.</p>
<p>It was a springtime morning long ago,<br />A morning of blue skies and whitest clouds,<br />And singing birds, and singing streams, and woods<br />That shone like silver, yet untouched with green:<br />The brethren of an abbey of the plain<br />—Whereof what now is ruin yet was whole—<br />Were labouring as holy brethren must,<br />Quietly, and in peace: and elder ones<br />Paced in the cloister, and some, older still,<br />Too old to work or dream, sat in the sunlight,<br />The sunlight which they soon should see no more.</p>
<p>And there came from the wood upon the hill<br />One clothed in the sere habit of a monk,<br />That passed in at the portal of the abbey:<br />Brighter his face than is the face of spring,<br />And joy was in his tread, as in his soul.</p>
<p>And some that paced the cloister paused to glance<br />    at him,<br />And one that went upon an errand stayed,<br />And some that laboured left their work, and came<br />Gathering round him, and he spake, and said:</p>
<p>    <!-- 22 -->“Very fair the golden morning<br />        As in yonder wood I strayed,<br />    And I heard diviner music<br />        Than the greatest harpers made,</p>
<p>    For a sweet bird sang before me<br />        Songs of laughter, and of tears.<br />    All that I have loved and longed for,<br />        As I measured out my years.</p>
<p>    Sang of blessed shores and golden<br />        Where the old, dim heroes be,<br />    Distant isles of sunset glory,<br />        Set beyond the western sea.</p>
<p>    Sang of Christ and Mary Mother<br />        Hearkening unto angels seven<br />    Playing on their golden harp-strings<br />        In the far courts of high Heaven.”</p>
<p>So they stood by, and listened to his speech,<br />Rhythmic, for that great joy was in his soul:<br />But while they wondered whence he was, and who,<br />He cast his eyes around, and, shuddering, cried:<br />“Who are ye, that I thought to be my brothers?<br />Strangers and sons of strangers! Where are they<br />I left behind me but an hour ago?”<br />Then was there whispering among the throng,<br />And wonder not a little, and some scorn;<br />Till he that spake, with anguish in his eye,<br />Cried: “Take me to a cell, that I may pray.”<br />’Twas done, and in the golden afternoon<br />A brother entered, and found none within,<br />Only a sere monk’s habit, and much dust,<br />As of a body crumbled in the grave.</p>
<!-- 23 -->
<p>And while they wondered what these things might be,<br />At last spake forth the oldest of them all,<br />Burdened with hundred winters in his soul:<br />“I can remember, when my years were young,<br />Hearing the old monks say, one went from here<br />When spring was on the earth, as it is now,<br />Some five-score years ago, and was not seen<br />Again, though search was made in all the land.”</p>
<p>And some believed this was the same, and all<br />Forgot it in a sennight’s silent toil.<br />Save one, that saw, and seeing understood,<br />And for the greater glory of High God<br />Wrote down the story in a mighty book,<br />And limned the old saint hearkening to the bird<br />With bright hues, and you still may read and see.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">O scholar</span> grey, with quiet eyes,<br />Reading the charactered pages, bright<br />With one tall candle’s flickering light,<br />In a turret chamber under the skies;<br />O scholar, learned in gramarye,<br />Have you seen the manifold things I see?</p>
<p>Have you seen the forms of tracèd towers<br />Whence clamorous voices challenge the hours:<br />Gaunt tree-branches, pitchy black<br />Against the long, wind-driven wrack<br />Of scurrying, shuddering clouds, that race<br />Ever across the pale moon’s face?</p>
<p>Have you heard the tramp of hurrying feet.<br />There beneath, in the shadowy street,<br />Have you heard sharp cries, and seen the flame<br />Of silvery steel, in a perilous game,<br />A perilous game for men to play,<br />Hid from the searching eyes of day?</p>
<p>Have you heard the great awakening breath,<br />Like trump that summons the saints from death,<br />Of the wild, majestical wind, which blows<br />Loud and splendid, that each man knows<br />Far, O far away is the sea,<br />Breaking, murmuring, stark and free?</p>
<!-- 25 -->
<p>All these things I hear and see,<br />I, a scholar of gramarye:<br />All are writ in the ancient books<br />Clear, exactly, and he that looks<br />Finds the night and the changing sea,<br />The years gone by, and the years to be:<br />(He that searches, with tireless eyes<br />In a turret-chamber under the skies)<br />Passion and joy, and sorrow and laughter,<br />Life and death, and the things thereafter.</p>

<p>What are we, what am I?<br />Poor rough creatures, whose life<br />Is “depressing” and “grey,”<br />Is a heart-breaking strife<br />With death and with shame<br />And your polite laughter,<br />Till—the world pass away<br />In smoke and in flame,<br />And some of us die,<br />And some live on after<br />To build it anew.</p>

<h2 id="afterwards">Afterwards</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Afterwards,</span> when<br />The old Gods’ hate<br />On the riven earth<br />No more is poured:</p>
<p>When weapons of war<br />Are all outworn<br />What shall become<br />Of the race of men?</p>
<p>One shall go forth<br />In the likeness of a child:<br />Under sere skies<br />Of a grey dawning:</p>
<p>One shall go forth<br />In the likeness of a child,<br />And desolate places<br />Shall spring and blossom:</p>
<p>One shall go forth<br />In the likeness of a child:<br />And men shall sing<br />And greatly rejoice:</p>
<p>All men shall sing<br />For the love that is in them,<br />And he shall behold it<br />And sing also.</p>

<h2 id="domum-redit-poeta">Domum redit Poeta</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">O much</span> desired from far away<br />    And long, I hold thee once again,<br />Thou undiminished treasury<br />    Of small delights, yet nowise vain:</p>
<p>The cat curled on the cosy hearth,<br />    The thrushes in the garden trees,<br />The memories of younger years,<br />    The quiet voices, and the peace.</p>
<!-- 63 -->
<h2 id="memories">Memories</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Shapes</span> in the mist, it is long since I saw you,<br />    Pale hands and faces, and quiet eyes,<br />Crowned with a garland the dead years wrought you<br />    Out of remembrance that never dies:</p>
<p>One among you is tall and supple<br />    Good to fight or to love beside,<br />Only the stain of a deadly quarrel,<br />    Only that and the years divide:</p>
<p>One there is with a face as honest,<br />    Heart as true, as the open sea,<br />One who never betrayed a comrade—<br />    Death stands now betwixt him and me.</p>
<p>One I loved with a passionate longing<br />    Born of worship and fierce despair,<br />Dreamed that Heaven were only happy<br />    If at length I should find him there.</p>
<p>Shapes in the mist, ye see me lonely,<br />    Lonely and sad in the dim firelight:<br />How far now to the last of all battles?<br />    (Listen, the guns are loud to-night!)</p>
<p>Whatever comes, I will strike once surely,<br />    Once because of an ancient tryst,<br />Once for love of your dear dead faces<br />    Ere I come unto you, Shapes in the mist.</p>
<!-- 64 -->
<h2 id="intercessional">Intercessional</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">There</span> is a place where voices<br />    Of great guns do not come,<br />Where rifle, mine, and mortar<br />    For evermore are dumb:<br />Where there is only silence,<br />    And peace eternal and rest,<br />Set somewhere in the quiet isles<br />    Beyond Death’s starry West.</p>
<p>O God, the God of battles,<br />    To us who intercede,<br />Give only strength to follow<br />    Until there’s no more need,<br />And grant us at that ending<br />    Of the unkindly quest<br />To come unto the quiet isles<br />    Beyond Death’s starry West.</p>

<h2 id="april-1916">April 1916</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Now</span> spring is come upon the hills in France,<br />And all the trees are delicately fair,<br />As heeding not the great guns’ voice, by chance<br />Brought down the valley on a wandering air:<br />Now day by day upon the uplands bare<br />Do gentle, toiling horses draw the plough,<br />And birds sing often in the orchards where<br />Spring wantons it with blossoms on her brow—<br />Aye! but there is no peace in England now.</p>
<p>O little isle amid unquiet seas,<br />Though grisly messengers knock on many doors,<br />Though there be many storms among your trees<br />And all your banners rent with ancient wars;<br />Yet such a grace and majesty are yours<br />There be still some, whose glad heart suffereth<br />All hate can bring from her misgotten stores,<br />Telling themselves, so England’s self draw breath,<br />That’s all the happiness on this side death.</p>

<h2 id="over-the-hills-and-hollows-green">“Over the Hills and Hollows Green”</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Over</span> the hills and hollows green<br />    The springtide air goes valiantly,<br />Where many sainted singing larks<br />    And blessed primaveras be:</p>
<p>But bitterly the springtide air<br />    Over the desert towns doth blow,<br />About whose torn and shattered streets<br />    No more shall children’s footsteps go.</p>
<!-- 67 -->
<h2 id="sonnet">Sonnet</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">To-night</span> the world is but a prison house,<br />And kindly ways, and all the springing grass<br />Are dungeon stones to him that may not pass<br />Among them, save with anguish on his brows:<br />And any wretched husbandman that ploughs<br />The upland acres in his habit spare<br />Is king, to those in palaces of glass<br />Who sit with grief and weariness for spouse.</p>
<p>O God, who madest first the world that we<br />Might happy live, and praise its pleasantness<br />In such wise as the angels never could,<br />Wherefore are hearts, fashioned so wondrously,<br />All spoiled and changed by human bitterness<br />Into the likenesses of stone and wood?</p>

<h2 id="o-long-the-fiends-of-war-shall-dance">“O Long the Fiends of War shall dance”</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">O long</span> the fiends of war shall dance<br />Upon the stricken fields of France:<br />And long and long their grisly cry<br />Shall echo up and smite the sky:<br />O long and long the tears of God<br />Shall fall upon a barren sod,<br />Save when, of His great clemency,<br />He gives men’s hearts in custody<br />Of grim old kindly Death, who knows<br />The mould is better than the rose.</p>

<h3 id="july-1916">July 1916</h3>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">O God,</span> whose great inscrutable purposes<br />(Seen only of the one all-seeing eye)<br />Are as unchangeable as the azure sky,<br />And as fulfilled of infinite mysteries:<br />Are like a fast-locked castle without keys<br />Whereof the gates are very strong and high,<br />Impenetrable, and we poor fools die<br />Nor even know what thing beyond them is:<br />O God, by whom men’s lives are multiplied,<br />    Are scattered broadcast in the world like grain,<br />        And after long time reaped again and stored,<br />O Thou who only canst be glorified<br />    By man’s own passion and the supreme pain,<br />        Accept this sacrifice of blood outpoured.</p>

<h2 id="sun-and-shadow-and-winds-of-spring">“Sun and Shadow and Winds of Spring”</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sun</span> and shadow and winds of spring,<br />    Love and laughter and hope and fame,<br />Cloud and storm-light over the hills,<br />    Tears and passion and sordid shame:</p>
<p>All, all are but as quenchèd fire<br />    And vanish’d smoke to him that lies<br />Amid the silence of the trees<br />    Under the silence of the skies.</p>
<!-- 71 -->
<h2 id="let-us-tell-quiet-stories-of-kind-eyes">“Let us tell Quiet Stories of Kind Eyes”</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Let</span> us tell quiet stories of kind eyes<br />    And placid brows where peace and learning sate:<br />Of misty gardens under evening skies<br />    Where four would walk of old, with steps sedate.</p>
<p>Let’s have no word of all the sweat and blood,<br />    Of all the noise and strife and dust and smoke<br />(We who have seen Death surging like a flood,<br />      Wave upon wave, that leaped and raced and broke).</p>
<p>Or let’s sit silently, we three together,<br />    Around a wide hearth-fire that’s glowing red,<br />Giving no thought to all the stormy weather<br />    That flies above the roof-tree overhead.</p>
<p>And he, the fourth, that lies all silently<br />    In some far-distant and untended grave,<br />Under the shadow of a shattered tree,<br />    Shall leave the company of the hapless brave,</p>
<p>And draw nigh unto us for memory’s sake,<br />    Because a look, a word, a deed, a friend,<br />Are bound with cords that never a man may break,<br />    Unto his heart for ever, until the end.</p>
<!-- 72 -->
<h2 id="save-that-poetic-fire">“Save that Poetic Fire”</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Save</span> that poetic fire<br />    Burns in the hidden heart,<br />Save that the full-voiced choir<br />    Sings in a place apart,</p>
<p>Man that’s of woman born,<br />    With all his imaginings,<br />Were less than the dew of morn,<br />    Less than the least of things.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-verses">The First Verses</h3>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Gather</span> great store of roses, crimson-red<br />    From ancient gardens under summer skies:<br />New opened buds, and some that soon must shed<br />    Their leaves to earth, that all expectant lies;<br />Some from the paths of poets’ wandering,<br />    Some from the places where young lovers meet,<br />Some from the seats of dreamers pondering,<br />    And all most richly red, and honey-sweet.</p>
<p>For in the splendour of the afternoon,<br />    When sunshine lingers on the glittering town<br />And glorifies the temples wondrous-hewn<br />    All set about it like a deathless crown,<br />We will go mingle with the solemn throng,<br />    With neither eyes that weep, nor hearts that bleed,<br />That to his grave with slow, majestic song<br />    Bears down the latest of the godlike seed.</p>
<p>Many a singer lies on distant isle<br />    Beneath the canopy of changing sky:<br />Around them waves innumerable smile,<br />    And o’er their head the restless seabirds cry:<br />But we will lay him far from sound of seas,<br />    Far from the jutting crags’ unhopeful gloom,<br />Where there blows never wind save summer breeze,<br />    And where the growing rose may clasp his tomb.</p>
<p>And thither in the splendid nights of spring,<br />    When stars in legions over heaven are flung,<br />Shall come the ancient gods, all wondering<br />    Why he sings not that had so richly sung:<br /><!-- 74 -->There Heracles with peaceful foot shall press<br />    The springing herbage, and Hephæstus strong,<br />Hera and Aphrodite’s loveliness,<br />    And the great giver of the choric song.</p>
<p>And thither, after weary pilgrimage,<br />    From unknown lands beyond the hoary wave,<br />Shall travellers through every coming age<br />    Approach to pluck a blossom from his grave:<br />Some in the flush of youth, or in the prime,<br />    Whose life is still as heapèd gold to spend,<br />And some who have drunk deep of grief and time,<br />    And who yet linger half-afraid the end.</p>
<h3 id="the-interlude">The Interlude</h3>
<p>It was upon a night of spring,<br />Even the time when first do sing<br />The new-returnèd nightingales;<br />Whenas all hills and woods and dales<br />Are resonant with melody<br />Of songs that die not, but shall be<br />Unto the latest hour of time<br />Beyond the life of word or rime—<br />Whenas all brooks more softly flow<br />Remembering lovers long ago<br />That stood upon their banks and vowed,<br />And love was with them like a cloud:<br />There came one out of Athens town<br />In a spun robe, with sandals brown,<br />Just when the white ship of the moon<br />Had first set sail, and many a rune<br />Was written in the argent stars;<br />His feet were set towards the hills<br />Because he knew that there the rills<br />Ran down like jewels, and fairy cars<br /><!-- 75 -->Galloped, maybe, among the dells,<br />And airy sprites wove fitful spells<br />Of gossamer and cold moonshine<br />Which do most mistily entwine:<br />And ever the hills called, and a voice<br />Cried: “Soon, maybe, comes thy choice<br />Twixt mortal immortality<br />Such as shall never be again,<br />’Twixt the most passionate-pleasant pain<br />And all the quiet, barren joys<br />That old men prate about to boys.”</p>
<hr />
<p>He wandered many nights and days—<br />Whose morns were always crystal clear,<br />As lay the world in still amaze<br />Enchanted of the springing year,<br />And all the nights with wakeful eyes<br />Watched for another dawn to rise—<br />Till at the last the mountain tops<br />Received him, which like giant props<br />Stand, lest the all-encircling sky<br />Fall down, and men be crushed and die.<br />And so he reached a curvèd hill<br />Whereon the hornèd moon did seem<br />Her richest radiance to spill<br />In an inestimable stream,<br />Like jewels rare of countless price,<br />Or wizard magic turned to ice.</p>
<hr />
<p>And as he reached the topmost crest of it,<br />Lo! the Olympian majesties did sit<br />In a most high and passionless conclave:<br />They ate ambrosia with their deathless lips,<br />And ever and anon the golden wave<br />Flowed of the drink divine, which only strips<br />This mortal frame of its mortality.<br />And there, and there was Aphrodite, she<br /><!-- 76 -->That is more lovely than the golden dawn<br />And from a ripple of the sea was born:<br />And there was Hera, the imperious queen,<br />And Dian’s chastity, that hunts unseen<br />What time with spring the woodland boughs are green:<br />And there was Pan with mirth and pleasantness,<br />And Eros’ self that never knew distress<br />Save for the love of the fair Cretan maid;<br />There Hermes with the wings of speed arrayed,<br />And awful Zeus, the king of gods and men,<br />And ever at his feet Apollo sang<br />A measure of changing harmonies that rang<br />From that high mountain over all the world,<br />And all the sails of fighting ships were furled,<br />And men drew breath, and there was peace again.<br />But him that saw, the sight like flame<br />Or depths of waters overcame:<br />He swooned, nor heard how ceased the choir<br />Of strings upon Apollo’s lyre,<br />Nor saw he how the sweet god stood<br />And smiled on him in kindly mood,<br />And stooped, and kissed him as he lay;<br />Then lightly rose and turned away<br />To join the bright immortal throng<br />And make for them another song.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-verses">The Last Verses</h3>
<p>O ageless nonpareil of stars<br />    That shinest through a mist of cloud,<br />O light beyond the prison bars<br />    Remote, unwavering, and proud;<br />Fortunate star and happy light,<br />Ye benison the gloom of night.</p>
<p>All hail, unfailing eye and hand,<br />    All hail, all hail, unsilenced voice,<br /><!-- 77 -->That makest dead men understand,<br />    The very dead in graves rejoice:<br />Whose utterance, writ in ancient books,<br />Shall always live, for him that looks.</p>
<p>Many as leaves from autumn trees<br />    The years shall flutter from on high,<br />And with their multiple decease<br />    The souls of men shall fall and die,<br />Yet, while the empires turn to dust,<br />You shall live on, because you must.</p>
<p>O seven times happy he that dies<br />    After the splendid harvest-tide,<br />When strong barns shield from winter skies<br />    The grain that’s rightly stored inside:<br />There death shall scatter no more tears<br />Than o’er the falling of the years:</p>
<p>Aye, happy seven times is he<br />    Who enters not the silent doors<br />Before his time, but tenderly<br />    Death beckons unto him, because<br />There’s rest within for weary feet<br />Now all the journey is complete.</p>

<h2 id="so-we-lay-down-the-pen">“So we lay down the Pen”</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">So</span> we lay down the pen,<br />So we forbear the building of the rime,<br />And bid our hearts be steel for times and a time<br />    Till ends the strife, and then,<br />When the New Age is verily begun,<br />God grant that we may do the things undone.</p>
